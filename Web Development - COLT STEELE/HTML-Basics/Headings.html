        The <b>chicken <span style="color: rgba(4, 1, 44, 0.333);">(Gallus domesticus)</span></b><br>
         is a large and round short-winged bird,
        domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago.
        Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.
    </p>



    <p>
        Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,
        and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per
        year.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.

    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p>
        Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are
        unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens
        and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[19]
        Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy
        crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under
        their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation
        that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[20]

    <h2> Reproduction and life-cycle </h2>

    <p>
        To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance),
        often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[32] The dance triggers a response in the hen[32]
        and when she responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.
        Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display.
        If the female is unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading
        with both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending display.[33]

    <h2> Dispersal </h2>


    <h3> Austronesia </h3>
    <p>
        A word for the domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language,
        indicating they were domesticated by the Austronesian peoples since ancient times. Chickens,
        together with dogs and pigs, were carried throughout the entire range of the prehistoric
        Austronesian maritime migrations to Island Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Island Melanesia,
        Polynesia, and Madagascar, starting from at least 3000 BC from Taiwan.[57][58][59][60]
        These chickens might have been introduced during pre-Columbian times to South America via
        Polynesian seafarers, but evidence for this is still putative.[61]
    </p>


    <h3> Americas </h3>
    <p>
        The possibility that domestic chickens were in the Americas before Western contact is
        debated by researchers, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia,
        suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens. A lack of data from Thailand,
        Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult
        to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and
        genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into
        this area.[62] Chicken bones from the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile were radiocarbon
        dated as pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis suggested they were related to prehistoric populations
        in Polynesia.[47][48] However, further study of the same bones cast doubt on the findings.[63][64]

    <h3> Eurasia </h3>
    <p>
        Chicken remains have been difficult to date, given the small and fragile bird bones; this may account
        for discrepancies in dates given by different sources. Archaeological evidence is supplemented
        by mentions in historical texts from the last few centuries BC, and by depictions in prehistoric
        artworks, such as across Central Asia.[65] Chickens were widespread throughout southern Central
        Asia by the 4th century BC.<sup><a href="link.com">[65]</a></sup>
